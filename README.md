# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person has heart disease based on clinical features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

The goal is to assist in early diagnosis of heart-related conditions using simple classification techniques.
